Hi, 

you’re reading this because you downloaded the files needed for the Design for Developers workshop in he Get into Wordpress Freelance event with Get Hired Crete.

You can reuse the design provided as you see fit. It’d be great to use it as a base for your own designs! Send me what you came up with (you can find me as @sugarenia in Twitter).

Thanks for attending, you rock.
